      "text": "um actually I was just curious if my location's serviceable for fiber but I'm not I'm not really actively looking to switch right now I'm kind of happy with my current provider so"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SalesRep",
      "text": "I understand uh this is just gonna be a discovery call to see if there are areas where we might be able to help you out with if I could just ask you real quick how much is the average speed you're getting from your current provider"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "text": "um I'm not sure I haven't really checked"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SalesRep",
      "text": "and what's your current provider"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "text": "bcnc"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SalesRep",
      "text": "and what do you usually use your connection for browsing gaming streaming"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "text": "um all sorts of things but mainly just browsing Face Time and streaming most of all"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SalesRep",
      "text": "and are totally happy with how the speed performs for each of these activities or do you think it could be better in some aspects"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "text": "I would say totally happy but mostly it's acceptable when watching videos at 4K there's definitely some lagging it doesn't matter which device on our phones on our TV it was just freeze for a few seconds and then resume I'm guessing it's the connection because it's definitely not the device we just bought this 4K TV last month and it's been happening like clockwork every time you're watching 4K other than that it's fine"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SalesRep",
      "text": "you know when streaming 4K videos you normally need 25 megabits per second to effectively load without lagging anything lower than 25 it would definitely slow you down one way or another"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "text": "oh really I wasn't exactly aware of that"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SalesRep",
      "text": "tell you what Vanessa why don't we test your connection and see how much speed you're exactly getting because I think you're getting less than 25 or if you are chances are it's not a consistent 25 throughout the day are you in front of your computer right now"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "text": "no but now that you raised that I'm actually curious since I haven't really checked the speed before huh uh all right let me just go to my computer what do you want me to do"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SalesRep",
      "text": "so if you could just open a browser and go to speedtest.net"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "text": "uh-huh speedtest.net okay"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SalesRep",
      "text": "and then click go once you're there"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "text": "okay it says oh wow this thing's moving"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SalesRep",
      "text": "yep that's the meter the first number should be your download speed"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "text": "okay it says 8.19 and there's another wheel coming up I guess that'll be the upload speed"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SalesRep",
      "text": "yep that'll be the upload speed"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "text": "huh so now it says 17.43 so 8.19 and 17.43"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SalesRep",
      "text": "so definitely not enough huh. You know when you're streaming videos we need to look at your download speed how much megabits you're downloading from the web per second okay your download speed is 8.19 that's good enough for 1080p but definitely not for 4K because you see 4K technically is four times the size of 1080p so that's like 2 million pixels versus 8 million pixels per second"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "text": "oh wow so that explains the lagging then"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SalesRep",
      "text": "oh definitely there's no doubt about it and that's what I'm calling you about today Vanessa if you want to make the most out of your 4K TV that have something much faster for you with an attractive pricing okay you could get up to 800 megabits per second which is roughly 100 times faster than your current download speed would you like to know more about the available plans"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "text": "well that sounds great but how much is it"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SalesRep",
      "text": "it depends on the plan but 800 megabits per second starts as low as 50 dollars per month plus installation fees"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "text": "um okay I I don't know that's kind of too much for me I I don't think we're willing to pay that much our internet is a little slow but it works for us most of the time so um I don't think so"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SalesRep",
      "text": "okay how much do you pay monthly for your current connection"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "text": "about 30 33 dollars something like that uh that's kind of like my price range I don't think I want to be paying any higher than that"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SalesRep",
      "text": "okay okay I get you let me check here okay because I might have something more suitable for you"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "text": "oh okay"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SalesRep",
      "text": "okay what if I tell you you can get 100 megabits per second for only 25 dollars with free installation fee"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "text": "25 for how much how much speed"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SalesRep",
      "text": "100 megabits not as fast as 800 but definitely 12 times faster than your current download speed more than enough to play 4K and cheaper than 33 dollars how does that sound"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "text": "huh that's getting interesting um but first i'm gonna have to talk to my husband about it um I also have to go to work now can you call me later after work this evening"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SalesRep",
      "text": "sure I can call you back at six or seven this evening which do you prefer"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "text": "seven should be fine"
